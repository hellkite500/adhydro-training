To get started, download  the `training_data.tar.gz` from the releases link to the right. (Use the latest release tag.)  Extract this data in project directory that is read/writable, as the rest of the training will be reading from this directory and producing additional files in it as well.

Next, pull the adhydro training docker images:

`docker pull hellkite500/adhydro`

`docker pull hellkite500/adhydro-tools`

Then follow the instructions in the [training page](ADHydro_training.md).
